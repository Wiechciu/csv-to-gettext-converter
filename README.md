# CSV to gettext converter for Godot

A Godot Editor addon that converts translation data stored in CSV files into [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) `.po` and `.pot` files.

Translations based on CSV files are limited in how they can be processed in Godot, e.g. translation context and plural forms are available only with gettext.

This addon makes it easier to convert existing CSV translation files into the gettext format, allowing it to be edited with professional localization software like [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to take advantage of all localization features, including translation context and plural forms, that are required for many languages.

Quoting [Godot Docs - Localization using gettext](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/i18n/localization_using_gettext.html), other advantages of using gettext over CSV are:
- gettext is a standard format, which can be edited using any text editor or GUI editors such as Poedit.
- gettext is supported by translation platforms such as Transifex and Weblate, which makes it easier for people to collaborate to localization.
- Compared to CSV, gettext works better with version control systems like Git, as each locale has its own messages file.
- Multiline strings are more convenient to edit in gettext files compared to CSV files.

## ⚙️ Usage

1. Prepare your translation CSV. Example format:  

   | key          | en           | de           | pl             |
   |--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
   | hello_world  | Hello World! | Hallo Welt!  | Witaj świecie! |
   | exit_game    | Exit Game    | Spiel Beenden| Wyjdź z gry    |

   - The first column is the **translation key**  
   - The following columns represent **languages** (`en`, `de`, `pl`, …)  

2. In the **FileSystem dock**, right-click on your CSV file  
3. Select **Convert CSV to gettext**

4. If any `.po` or `.pot` files already exist in that directory, you’ll be asked whether they should be overwritten

5. After confirmation, the plugin generates:  
   - A `.pot` template file from the source language  
   - `.po` files for each target language

## 📂 Example Output

Source file:
- `/translation/translation.csv`

Generated files:
- `/translation/translation.pot`
- `/translation/en.po`
- `/translation/de.po`
- `/translation/pl.po`

The `translation.pot` file will contain only keys without any translations: 
```
msgid "hello_world"
msgstr ""

msgid "exit_game"
msgstr ""
```

Each `.po` file will contain a key with translation, e.g. `en.po` will contain:
```
msgid "hello_world"
msgstr "Hello World!"

msgid "exit_game"
msgstr "Exit Game"
```

Or add it through code:

```gdscript
# Load a PO file into the TranslationServer
var translation: Translation = load("res://translation/de.po")
